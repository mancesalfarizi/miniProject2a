According to the [dataset codebook](https://epistat.sciensano.be/COVID19BE_codebook.pdf), dates for new testing figures correspond to the date of laboratory diagnosis (or when not available, date of sampling). 

It is unclear whether the testing figures include technologies other than PCR tests. In a communication on 3 April 2020, Sciensano indicates that an antigen test made by Coris Bioconcept may now be used for COVID-19 detection. The communication states that positive antigen test results do not have to be confirmed by a PCR test, but that negative or doubtful cases must be confirmed by a PCR test.

Official figures reported in Sciensano's daily epidemiological bulletins do not help to clarify whether non-PCR tests are included in the daily time series figures. For example, as of 10 May 2020, the [official time series dataset](https://epistat.sciensano.be/covid/covid19_historicaldata.html) reported a cumulative total of 465,201 tests performed between 1 March and 9 May 2020. However, the epidemiological bulletin for [10 May 2020](https://covid-19.sciensano.be/sites/default/files/Covid19/COVID-19_Daily%20report_20200510%20-%20FR.pdf) states that 325,796 cumulative tests had been performed by laboratories between the beginning of March and 9 May 2020, while an additional 240,305 tests had been performed through the national testing platform (566,101 total tests).

The bulletin indicates that these figures include both PCR and antigen tests, suggesting that the large discrepancy between the 465,201 figure and the combined 566,101 figure may be due to the fact that the official time series data only includes PCR tests, whereas the official bulletin figures include both PCR and antigen tests. However, we have been unable to find official documentation from Sciensano that resolves this ambiguity."

The briefs often (but do not always) provide a breakdown of the cumulative number of confirmed, suspected, and negative (also called discarded) tests to date. We measure the total number of tests performed to date as the sum of the number of confirmed and negative tests.

Because of the way the daily briefs report the number of negative tests (""pruebas negativas"") alongside the number of positive cases (""casos positivos""), it may be the case that the number of tests performed is equivalent to the number of people tested.

As of 5 August 2020, the most recent daily briefs consistently report testing figures in terms of the cumulative number of tests (""pruebas"") performed. However, in the initial months of the COVID-19 outbreak, the daily briefs previously reported testing figures using inconsistent terminology such as samples (“muestras”) tested, people who have undergone tests (”personas, que fueron sometidas a pruebas”), and tests (""pruebas"") performed. It does not appear that this inconsistent use of terminology reflects a substantive change in the reported figures, since there are no corresponding large breaks in the time series.

In 10 briefs the number of negative tests was not reported, preventing us from calculating a total for that date. For these dates with missing official data, we use data provided in this [unofficial GitHub repository](https://github.com/mauforonda/covid19-bolivia), which we have cross-referenced against the official data for all dates.

These report the number and status of confirmed cases, deaths and number of samples tested. This data is available daily from 18 March 2020; reports and infographics prior to this date do not include the number of samples tested. But all figures are dated cumulative since 29 February 2020.

The source reports the number of confirmed ('confirmados') and negative ('descartados') cases, which we sum to get the number of cases tested.

On 24 April 2020, the number of tests suddenly jumped from 23,383 to 45,857, because of what we assume to be the inclusion of rapid tests (""pruebas rápidas""), as made clear by the subsequent infographic published on 27 April 2020. We therefore do not include the 24 April 2020 infographic in our time series; and from 27 April 2020 onwards, we include only PCR tests.

On 11 May 2020, the Government of Ecuador published a [report](https://www.gestionderiesgos.gob.ec/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/BP-VARIACIONES-INFOGRAFIA-No.-074-11052020.pdf) detailing ""a reclassification of the records by identity card of the persons and not by the number of tests that have been carried out"". This suggests the government is moving towards reporting figures on the number of people tested, where previously they reported the number of cases tested. The reclassification partially explains the fall in the cumulative total after 4 May 2020.

Note that, due to the way the data is presented by the official source, the time series may be impacted by retrospective revisions made by the source – see our [FAQ here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#does-your-data-reflect-retrospective-updates-made-by-the-source).

Ecuador includes positive antibody tests in their figures for confirmed cases. Our testing figures—which exclude antibody tests—are not an appropriate comparison in these instances: on this basis there could be more cases than tests, which is not possible. For this reason, we do not calculate the positive rate or number of tests per confirmed case for Ecuador."

- ""Coronavirus testing is performed in both the public and private sectors in several laboratories.""

The data description notes that tests are being rationed and allocated according to the following strategy: ""Samples are taken primarily from patients with severe symptoms of respiratory infection and from health and social care staff to ensure staff health and labor adequacy....Attention has also been paid to vulnerable groups of patients with some underlying disease and to those over 70 years of age.""

Note that the number of laboratories reporting in the data seems to vary from week to week.,"To determine how many laboratory tests regarding SARS-CoV-2 are carried out per calendar week in Germany and how many tests are positive or negative, the RKI has started a Germany-wide laboratory query. However, the number of laboratories reporting data seems to vary from week to week.

The report published on 2 August 2020 states that “from the beginning of the collection up to and including calendar week 31/2020”:
– The cumulative total of samples tested was 8,586,648;
- For calendar week 31 (which ends 2 August), 161 labs reported 573,802 samples tested;
- For calendar week 30 (which ends 26 July), 176 labs reported 569,868 samples tested;
- For calendar week 29 (which ends 19 July), 173 labs reported 537,334 samples tested;
- For calendar week 28 (which ends 12 July), 177 labs reported 509,298 samples tested;
- For calendar week 27 (which ends 5 July), 150 labs reported 505,518 samples tested;
- For calendar week 26 (which ends 28 June), 180 labs reported 467,004 samples tested;
- For calendar week 25 (which ends 21 June), 175 labs reported 387,484 samples tested;
- For calendar week 24 (which ends 14 June), 172 labs reported 326,645 samples tested;
- For calendar week 23 (which ends 7 June), 176 labs reported 340,986 samples tested;
- For calendar week 22 (which ends 31 May), 178 labs reported 405,269 samples tested;
- For calendar week 21( which ends 24 May), 179 labs reported 353,467 samples tested;

- For calendar week 17 (which ends on 26 April), 178 labs reported 363,890 samples tested;
- For calendar week 16 (which ends on 19 April), 168 labs reported 331,902 samples tested;
- For calendar week 15 (which ends on 12 April), 164 labs reported 380,197 samples tested;
– For calendar week 14 (which ends on 5 April), 154 labs reported 408,348 samples tested;
– For calendar week 13 (which ends on 29 March), 151 labs reported 361,515 samples tested;
– For calendar week 12 (which ends on 22 March), 152 labs reported 348,619 samples tested;
– For calendar week 11 (which ends on 15 March), 114 labs reported 127,457 samples tested.
– Up to and including calendar week 10 (which ends on 8 March), 90 labs reported 124,716 samples tested.

By subtracting each weekly change from the cumulative total, we retrospectively work out the cumulative totals by the end of each week.

Since laboratories can post-check the tests of past calendar weeks in the RKI test number query, previous figures may be revised upwards slightly in subsequent reports. The source is explicit that these figures refer to tests performed and that this will not equal the number of people tested, because of multiple tests per person."

Between 10 and 26 May 2020, the daily situation updates provide figures for both the number of samples tested and the number of persons tested. Over this period the two figures differ from one another by exactly 981 tests on each day, which is due to the fact that many of the 1,041 cumulative persons tested under mandatory quarantine were tested multiple times (2,022 samples tested on 1,041 persons). This discrepancy of 981 tests is small, representing less than 1% of cumulative samples tested at the time. In contrast, the cumulative number of samples tested through routine surveillance and contact tracing are exactly equal to the cumulative number of persons tested on each day in these respective categories.

Prior to 10 May 2020, the daily situation updates provide testing figures using inconsistent terminology, varying between ""samples tested"", ""persons tested"", ""suspected cases tested"", and similar language. Nevertheless, we choose to include all of these figures within our constructed time series, since the variation in terminology does not appear to correspond to large breaks in the time series. In addition, based on the fact that the number of samples tested differs only slightly from the number of persons tested over the 10 May to 26 May 2020 period, we have no reason to believe that the variation in terminology prior to 10 May has any serious ramifications for the interpretation of the time series as the cumulative number of samples tested.

From 10 May 2020 onwards, the daily situation updates consistently report the cumulative number of samples tested."

No other details are provided.

The press releases from ICMR do not always stay online for very long. The reason for this is unknown, but the releases are being backed up at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/datameet/covid19).

On some occasions there appear to have been more than one update released per day. Where we are aware of multiple observations for the day, we show the number for the earlier release.

The ICMR website does not explicitly state whether the reported figures refer to PCR tests only. From contextual information, it appears that the reported figures may also include samples that were tested using a TrueNat non-PCR test. ICMR communications on [21 May 2020](https://www.icmr.gov.in/pdf/press_realease_files/ICMR_Press_Release_TruNat_21052020.pdf) and [19 April 2020](https://www.icmr.gov.in/pdf/covid/labs/Additional_guidance_on_TrueNat_based_COVID19_testing.pdf) indicate that TrueNat tests are being used in diagnostic testing. These TrueNat tests likely account for a small minority of all samples tested.

The dashboard shows the latest number of ""Kasus dg Spesimen Diperiksa"", which translates to ""Cases with Specimens Checked"".

Daily changes in the number of people tested are included in parentheses. For 3 April and 21 April 2020, the daily changes do not reconcile with the cumulative totals. Moreover, it is clear that revisions to past data are simply added to the new cumulative total, making the time series of 'daily tests' very erratic.

This includes three cases where the cumulative number of people tested falls: (1) 19 March 2020; (2) 25 March 2020; and (3) 15 May 2020. For case (1) see footnote 4 which indicates a past mistake has been noticed and the cumulative figure revised on the date to adjust for this. For case (2), we could not find the associated footnote. For case (3), see footnote 3 of the press release which indicates a past mistake has been noticed and the cumulative figure revised on the date to adjust for this.

It isn't clear what exact date these cumulative tests date back to, but it is earlier than 10 February 2020 when the source reports 938 people had been tested. Prior to 10 February 2020, the press releases provide reports of coronavirus infections for the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama port. We do not report these numbers in the time series as it is unclear how they relate to the cumulative totals.

(4,000 or more) is increasing"" (translated). In the MOH's 15 July 2020 press release, footnote 3 mentions that ""For some local governments, the number of antigen testers is included.""

From 20 May 2020, the MOH changed how it reports the number of tests performed.

The tweets and press releases usually report testing figures in terms of the number of ""samples tested"". However, the wording used in some tweets and press releases makes it unclear whether the figures relate to the number of samples tested or the number of people tested. For example, the relevant tweet on [4 June 2020](https://twitter.com/MOH_Kenya/status/1268563481235787776) says ""2,640 samples tested in the last 24 hours"", while the relevant tweet on [1 August 2020](https://twitter.com/MOH_Kenya/status/1289552051916009475) states that ""727 people are the latest to test positive for Covid-19 from a sample of 6,371 tested in the last 24 hrs"". It does not appear that this inconsistency in terminology reflects a substantive change in the figures that are reported, since there are no large breaks in the time series that correspond to the use of ""samples tested"" versus ""people tested"" terminology. Instead, the wording of the tweets and press releases suggests that the reported number of samples tested may be equivalent to the number of people tested.

From 16–25 June 2020, we used the reported total, which likely includes pending tests. Before the 16th when negative numbers were reported, we used the total of positive and negative numbers rather than the reported total, since the latter generally included pending values and occasionally contained discrepant numbers that did not match any combination of the positive, negative, or pending numbers.

The dashboard reports testing figures as ""total tests"", making it unclear whether the figures refer to the number of samples tested, tests performed, or people tested. Nevertheless, corresponding press  releases from [the Ministry of Health](https://www.moh.gov.sa/en/Ministry/MediaCenter/News/Pages/default.aspx) imply that the figures refer to the total number of tests performed. For example, the [26 July 2020 press release](https://www.moh.gov.sa/en/Ministry/MediaCenter/News/Pages/News-2020-07-26-004.aspx) states that ""...57,216 new Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) have been conducted in the Kingdom’s laboratories, bringing the total number to 3,056,956 lab tests"". This 3,056,956 figure differs slightly from the figure of 3,047,668 tests reported on the official dashboard on 26 July 2020, but we assume this small discrepancy is due to differences in reporting time rather than a substantive difference in units (e.g. tests performed vs. people tested).

The exact date these cumulative figures date back to is unknown.

The first estimate in our time series comes from a Ministry of Health press release, quoting Salvador Illa, Minister of Health: ""From the beginning of the crisis and until April 13, the total number of PCR carried out in Spain is 930,230."" The press release is [here](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/gabinete/notasPrensa.do?metodo=detalle&id=4864).

The second is another Ministry of Health press release published on 27 April 2020 and relating to testing conducted up to 23 April 2020. It provides a breakdown across Autonomous Communities (regions), with a total for Spain of 1,035,522 PCR tests. The same release provides a figure of 310,038 antibody tests conducted nationwide. These are different to the PCR tests, as we discuss [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing#different-types-of-tests-for-covid-19). Our database aims to not include antibody tests. So in order to provide the data that is most comparable to the other countries in our database, we include only the PCR tests count for this observation.

One aspect of the 27 April 2020 press release that is not totally clear is whether the figures provided for each Autonomous Community relate to the 23 April 2020. Comparing the regional breakdowns provided in the Ministry of Health release to those collected from official sources by CIVIO (as of 28 April 2020) suggests that the figure of 203,892 provided for Madrid in the Ministry of Health update—ostensibly dating to the 23 April 2020—may date back to 14 April 2020.

Further data points are collected from the [Ministry of Health's press releases](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/gabinete/notasPrensa.do?metodo=verHistorico) or [its Twitter account](https://twitter.com/sanidadgob).

[CIVIO](https://datos.civio.es/dataset/pcr-coronavirus-covid19-espana-comunidades-autonomas/) is a non-profit investigative data journalism organisation who are collating information on tests performed within each Autonomous Community, as released through official channels (communication offices, web pages, press releases and social networks of the different regions).

Note that, due to the way the data is presented by the official source, the time series may be impacted by retrospective revisions made by the source – see our [FAQ here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#does-your-data-reflect-retrospective-updates-made-by-the-source).

Daily case reports (e.g. [5 August 2020](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/documentos/Actualizacion_178_COVID-19.pdf)) published by the Ministry of Health note that ""total cases [are] confirmed by PCR until 10 May, and by PCR and IgM (only if compatible symptoms) according to the new surveillance strategy from 11 May"".

This could have indicated that Spain included positive antibody tests in their figures for confirmed cases. As we explain in [this FAQ](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#why-do-you-not-report-the-positive-rate-or-tests-per-case-for-all-countries-in-the-dataset), we do not present figures for the positive rate or number of tests per confirmed case for countries where we believe this to be the case.

However, this footnote importantly says that positive IgM results are only counted if they have ""compatible symptoms"", i.e. if patients are actively infected by the virus.

[This report](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/documentos/COVID19_Estrategia_vigilancia_y_control_e_indicadores.pdf) published on 9 July 2020 also makes clear on page 4 that IgM tests included in new confirmed cases do not correspond to massive serology testing for past infections, but rather to active, symptomatic infections with a negative PCR result but for which further IgM testing came back positive.

In the same way, the documentation published by the Carlos III Health Institute on [its COVID-19 website](https://cnecovid.isciii.es/covid19/#documentaci%C3%B3n-y-datos) states that ""as of May 11, the Ministry of Health is counting the confirmed cases diagnosed by PCR (and in some specific cases those diagnosed by IgM by ELISA)"", i.e. the inclusion of IgM does not mean the inclusion of massive antibody testing results, but rather specific instances where current infections are confirmed via IgM instead of PCR.

Pending new information that would prove otherwise, we therefore do not exclude Spain from the calculation of the positive rate and number of tests per case, as IgM tests for active cases represent a very small number and therefore should not affect these ratios."

UKR,Ukraine - tests performed,2020-08-10,https://covid19.gov.ua/en,Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine,,108,1179434,26.969,10083,0.231,16061,0.367,0.087,11.485,Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine,https://www.kmu.gov.ua/en,The number of tests performed,"The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine provides [daily snapshots](https://covid19.gov.ua) that report the cumulative number of tests performed to date. 

It is unclear whether the reported figures include tests pending results.

In the daily snapshots, the wording used to report the cumulative testing figures does not make it clear as to whether the reported figures relate to the number of tests performed or the number of persons tested. For example, the cumulative testing figure reported on 6 August 2020 is ""1,116,641 tested"" (translated from ""протестовано""). The [english version](https://covid19.gov.ua/en) of the same page reports the same figure as ""total of tests"", which is also unclear. [A more detailed dashboard](https://covid19.gov.ua/analitichni-paneli-dashbordy) on the same web domain provides testing figures in downloadable csv files dating back to 1 June 2020, where each csv file contains separate columns for the cumulative number of PCR tests and non-PCR tests. The cumulative PCR testing figures reported in these csv files are described as ""The number of laboratory tests performed by PCR on COVID-19"" (""Кількість проведених лабораторних досліджень методом ПЛР на COVID-19""), making it clear that the figures refer to the number of tests performed (which may or may not be equivalent to the number of people tested).

The cumulative PCR testing figures provided in the csv files tend to be approximately 2% smaller than the testing figures provided in the daily snapshots. Nevertheless, we assume that this discrepancy is due to small differences in the reference date, reporting laboratories included, or other minor details, rather than the possibility that the daily snapshot figures include non-PCR tests or refer to a metric other than the number of tests performed. The cumulative number of non-PCR tests reported in the csv files are much larger than the size of this discrepancy.

The earliest reported figure that we have been able to find is from 9 April 2020, at which point 20,608 cumulative tests were reported.

We aggregate the data for the United Kingdom based only on two 'pillars':

- Pillar 1: swab (antigen) testing in Public Health England (PHE) labs and NHS hospitals for those with a clinical need and health and care workers;
- Pillar 2: swab (antigen) testing for the wider population.

For both pillars, we use the 'Daily number of tests processed' and 'Cumulative number of tests processed' columns to create of time series of PCR tests performed in the United Kingdom. We do not include tests delivered or sent out that have not been recorded as having been processed.

We do not include other pillars, i.e.:

- Pillar 3: this pillar consists (fully) of serology tests, which we aim not to include;
- Pillar 4: this pillar consists (partly) of serology tests, which we aim not to include, and positive tests results from this pillar seem not to be included in the government's total for positive cases.

The source notes that 'data on UK tests is updated daily. The figures for test results are compiled from different sources. Daily totals reflect actual counts reported for the previous day. Each day there may be corrections to previous reported figures. This means that previously published daily counts will not necessarily sum to the latest cumulative figure. It also means that today’s cumulative count may not match the previous day’s cumulative count plus today’s daily count.'"

The figures are the sum across states, some of which appear to include antibody tests in addition to PCR tests.","On 13 May 2020, the United States CDC's testing data was modified to include tests performed by commercial, hospital, public health, and CDC laboratories. This new data is available on the [Testing Data in the US](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html) page and [CDC COVID Data Tracker](https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/index.html).

Initially, this data was explicitly described by the CDC as only including viral tests and excluding antibody tests. As recently as [18 May](https://web.archive.org/web/20200518050707/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html) the site stated that 'These data only represent viral tests. Antibody tests are not currently captured in these data.'

However, as of 26 May 2020, there have been a number of media reports noting that the testing figures released by some states – which are aggregated by the CDC – include antibody tests in addition to PCR tests, as discussed in [this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/cdc-and-states-are-misreporting-covid-19-test-data-pennsylvania-georgia-texas/611935/) in The Atlantic. 

Within this time, the CDC have also changed the way it described the data to be ambiguous as to whether anitbody tests may be included in their figures (see [26 May 2020 update](http://web.archive.org/web/20200526082029/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html)). Our dataset aims to report only PCR tests. But because any antibody tests in the CDC data are not disaggregated, we are unable to exclude them.

No time series is published for this new version of the data. We therefore started collecting on 13 May 2020 the cumulative total of viral tests reported, which is updated daily.

As of [26 May 2020](http://web.archive.org/web/20200526082029/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html), the notes to the data provided by the CDC are limited. They state:

- These data are compiled from a number of sources. Not all tests are reported to CDC.
- The number of positive tests in a state is not equal to the number of cases, as one person may be tested more than once.

The CDC previously published a time series that only covered public health labs and did not include private lab tests, which were occurring in significant numbers. Daily figures were provided since 18 January. This data is still visible on [this page of the CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/previous-testing-in-us.html).

Testing data is gathered from individual states, as reported in state health department websites, data dashboards and press releases from officials.

As of 26 May 2020, there have been a number of media reports noting that the testing figures released by some states include antibody tests in addition to PCR tests – as discussed in [this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/cdc-and-states-are-misreporting-covid-19-test-data-pennsylvania-georgia-texas/611935/) in The Atlantic. Our dataset aims to report only PCR tests. But because some states do not disaggregate these types of tests we are not currently able to exclude the antibody tests.

Other differences across states include: some report the number of tests performed, others the number of people tested; some include private labs, others not; some report negative test results, others only positive test results; some include pending tests, others do not (below we show figures that exclude explicitly pending results).

Moreover, many states do not explicitly provide details about these important factors needed to interpret the data they provide. 

There are issues in comparing the figures over time. The totals given for early on in the outbreak do not include all states. One significant uncertainty is the extent to which the rapid rise in tests seen from the mid-March in part reflects states beginning to report private lab tests.

Overall the figures should be seen as providing a general indication of testing output, rather than a specific count of a given indicator. Given the very incomplete coverage and reporting delays of the CDC data, it provides a very important additional perspective.

The Project documents their work in lots of detail. See the link provided above for full details."

This figure generally matches the sum of confirmed cases and negative samples, suggesting that the total number of samples tested may be equivalent to the number of people tested  (there are occasionally small discrepancies – we report the sum of positive and negative in these cases). However, it is unclear whether 'negative samples' includes instances of resampling for the same person.

Using web archives we can reconstruct a daily time-series of total samples tested. These daily updates extend back to 2 March 2020. We cannot say with certainty when testing began, only that 1,753 samples had been tested as of 2 March 2020.
